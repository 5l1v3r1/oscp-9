## Introduction

I created this braindump repo to help me organize my thoughts around reaching a OSCP certification. It mainly contains stuff (in various notes) I want to remember or I found to come in handy during my studies.

## What is OSCP

It is an IT security certification track offered by [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/)
